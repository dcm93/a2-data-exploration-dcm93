                The data presented in this tool describes U.S craft beers, their styles, their alcoholic by volume rate (ABV), international
                bitterness unit rate (IBU) and their brewery of origin. Given that each beer has information on itself and
                on the brewery that produces it, I explored layouts that allow me to provide information, on the beer itself
                and on its origin, while preventing information overload and cluttering.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first candidates included a bar chart and a pie chart binned by U.S regions and a U.S map with geolocated bubbles for
                each beer matching a selection criteria. However, these options were soon replaced by a zoomable circle packing
                layout.
            </p>
            <p> I proceeded with this choice because it allowed me to present several layers of information in the same graph,
                something not afforded by more traditional layouts such as the bar and pie charts. Additionally, this layout
                did not force me to reduce my dataset to a few summarizing operations to fit a summarizing chart, as was
                again the case with the pie and bar chart. Furthermore, unlike the U.S Bubble map layout, the circle packing
                layout did not depend on geographical location to provide a space for each observation, which prevents cluttering
                and collision. Finally, the circle packing layout allowed me to organize beers by their region of origin,
                without recurring to a map.

            <p>
                My data tool counts with 4 filters: Zooming, Style, ABV and IBU. It is important to note that my tool uses a combination
                of Style, ABV and IBU to present results for each region. Therefore, to obtain better results, users must
                select an option for each of said filters. Functionality for each filter is explained below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zooming: users are first presented with a grouping of beers by each region, represented by a larger circle
                    populated by smaller circles of the same color. Upon clicking on any grouping, the user is presented
                    with each bubble containing the beer’s name, its brewery of origin, its ABV and IBU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Style Filter: users can choose from a list of beer styles such as Pale Ale, Brown Ale, Pilsner, etc. With this filter, they
                    can explore which beer style is most popular in each U.S region.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alcohol by Volume Rate Filter: users can filter all U.S beers by their Alcohol by Volume rate, represented by 4 categories:
                    Not Detectable, Mild, Noticeable and Harsh. It is important to note that, despite choosing a particular
                    ABV, bubble size and proportion will always be given by ABV. This choice was made due to the fact that
                    ABV is a more objective measure than IBU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    International Bitterness Units Rate Filter: users can filter all U.S beers by their International Bitterness Units Rate.
                    It is important to note that IBU is less objective than ABV given than bitterness is relative for each
                    person and their particular taste. So, since bitterness is most closely related to the amount of hops
                    present in a beer, the user can choose “Not Hoppy”, “Moderately Hoppy”, “Very Hoppy” and “Extremely Hoppy”
                    as levels of “bitterness.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p> Some of the insights found are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The most popular beer style in every U.S region is Pale Ale, followed by Brown Ale and Porter.</li>
                <li>"Extremely Hoppy" beers, or those that would be considered to be extremely bitter are very rare in the U.S and the few in existence are
                    produced in the West region</li>
                <li>Generally, the West region dominates in number of breweries and number of products produced. This region is followed by the Northeast.</li>
                <li>The most popular Alcohol by Volume rate in the U.S is "Mild", which encompasses rates between 4.6 and 6.0 %.
                </li>
                <li>The most popular level of bitterness, as indicated by IBU, is Moderately Hoppy, with rates between 26 and 50 hop acids in parts-per-million.
                    </li>
            </ul>
